# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the foundational memory bank documentation for the `python-tools` project. This involves creating and populating the core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) to ensure comprehensive project understanding for future interactions.

## Recent Changes

-   **`delete_with_regex.py` created:** A new Python utility was developed to delete files based on a regex pattern, including a `--dry-run` option.
-   **`README.md` updated:** The main `README.md` file was updated to include documentation for the `delete_with_regex.py` utility, with usage examples and regex pattern guidance.
-   **Memory Bank Initialization:** Started populating the memory bank with `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps

-   Complete the initialization of the memory bank by creating `progress.md`.
-   Ensure all core memory bank files are comprehensive and accurately reflect the project's current state and context.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   **Documentation Priority:** Maintaining up-to-date and detailed memory bank documentation is a high priority to ensure seamless task resumption and context transfer.
-   **Utility Scope:** Each utility should remain focused on a single, well-defined task to maintain modularity and ease of use.
-   **Safety Features:** Destructive utilities must always include a `--dry-run` option for user safety and verification.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   **Python Standard Library Preference:** Favoring standard library modules over external dependencies to minimize setup complexity.
-   **Clear CLI:** All utilities should have clear, self-documenting command-line interfaces using `argparse`.
-   **Robust Logging:** Utilize Python's `logging` module for all output, avoiding `print` statements.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   The initial `delete_with_regex.py` utility demonstrated the effectiveness of combining `os.walk` with `re` for flexible file system operations.
-   The importance of clear regex examples in documentation was highlighted by the user's follow-up question regarding specific file deletion patterns.
