# Project Brief

This project, `python-tools`, is a collection of various Python utilities designed to automate common tasks.

## Core Requirements:

-   Provide modular and reusable Python scripts.
-   Each script should address a specific utility function (e.g., file deletion, data processing).
-   Scripts should be command-line runnable with clear argument parsing.
-   Include a `--dry-run` option for destructive operations where applicable.
-   Adhere to Python best practices (PEP 8, logging, error handling).
-   Maintain clear and concise documentation for each utility.

## Goals:

-   Enhance developer productivity by providing readily available tools.
-   Ensure robustness and reliability of the utilities.
-   Facilitate easy extension and addition of new tools.
