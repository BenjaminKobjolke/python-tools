# Progress

## What Works

-   The `delete_with_regex.py` utility is fully implemented and functional.
    -   It correctly parses command-line arguments (`--path`, `--regex`, `--dry-run`).
    -   It recursively traverses directories and matches file names against the provided regex.
    -   The `--dry-run` functionality correctly previews deletions without actual file removal.
    -   Actual file deletion works as expected when `--dry-run` is not specified.
    -   Robust error handling for invalid paths and regex patterns is in place.
    -   Logging provides clear feedback on script operations.
-   The `README.md` file has been updated with comprehensive documentation for `delete_with_regex.py`, including usage and examples for common regex patterns.
-   The core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created and populated, providing a foundational understanding of the project.

## What's Left to Build

-   No specific new utilities or features are currently pending. The immediate task of initializing the memory bank is nearing completion.

## Current Status

-   The `python-tools` project has its first functional utility (`delete_with_regex.py`).
-   The project's foundational documentation (Memory Bank) is being established to ensure maintainability and context for future development.

## Known Issues

-   No known bugs or critical issues with the `delete_with_regex.py` utility.
-   No known issues with the current memory bank documentation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   The decision to use Python's standard library extensively has proven effective for minimizing external dependencies and simplifying deployment.
-   The emphasis on clear CLI arguments and a `--dry-run` option for destructive operations has been validated as crucial for user safety and usability.
-   The importance of detailed documentation, especially for regex patterns, was reinforced by user interaction, leading to more explicit examples in the `README.md`.
